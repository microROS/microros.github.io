Background:

- Tobias' paper
- CGL- Executor
Predictable execution under given real-time constraints is a crucial requirement for many robotic applications, but is also a complex subject which could cause many errors. The real-time Executor aims to provide a convenient API for the developers of micro-ROS based components and systems to simplify scheduling and to reduce errors, taking advantage of typical processing patterns in robotics applications.

The approaches presented here are based on the concept of executors, which have been introduced in ROS 2. The real-time Executors shall provide fine-grained control of the mapping of callbacks to the scheduling primitives and mechanisms of the underlying RTOS, even across multiple nodes.

First, the ROS 2 Executor concept is described. Then a first approach, the Callback-group-level Executor is presented and as a second approach, a static-order scheduler based on RCL is introduced. Finally, we present the project roadmap and related work.

## ROS 2 Executor Concept

ROS 2 allows to bundle multiple nodes in one operating system process. To coordinate the execution of the callbacks of the nodes of a process, the Executor concept was introduced in rclcpp (and also in rclpy).

### Description
The ROS 2 design defines one Executor (instance of [rclcpp::executor::Executor](https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/blob/master/rclcpp/include/rclcpp/executor.hpp)) per process, which is typically created either in a custom main function or by the launch system. The Executor coordinates the execution of all callbacks issued by these nodes by checking for available work (timers, services, messages, subscriptions, etc.) from the DDS queue and dispatching it to one or more threads, implemented in [SingleThreadedExecutor](https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/blob/master/rclcpp/include/rclcpp/executors/single_threaded_executor.hpp) and [MultiThreadedExecutor](https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp/blob/master/rclcpp/include/rclcpp/executors/multi_threaded_executor.hpp), respectively.

The dispatching mechanism resembles the ROS 1 spin thread behavior: the Executor looks up the wait queues, which notifies it of any pending callback in the DDS queue. If there are pending callbacks, the ROS 2 Executor simply executes them in a FIFO manner.


### Architecture

The following diagram depicts the relevant classes of the ROS 2 Executor concept:

![ROS 2 Executor class diagram](executor_class_diagram.png)

Note that an Executor instance maintains weak pointers to the NodeBaseInterfaces of the nodes only. Therefore, nodes can be destroyed safely, without notifying the Executor.

Also, the Executor does not maintain an explicit callback queue, but relies on the queue mechanism of the underlying DDS implementation as illustrated in the following sequence diagram:

![Call sequence from executor to DDS](executor_to_dds_sequence_diagram.png)

### Analysis
The Executor concept, however, does not provide means for prioritization or categorization of the incoming callback calls. Moreover, it does not leverage the real-time characteristics of the underlying operating-system scheduler to have finer control on the order of executions. The overall implication of this behavior is that time-critical callbacks could suffer possible deadline misses and a degraded performance since they are serviced later than non-critical callbacks. Additionally, due to the FIFO mechanism, it is difficult to determine usable bounds on the worst-case latency that each callback execution may incur.

## Callback-group-level Executor
 We propose a callback-group-level Executor, which is based on the Executor concept of the ROS 2 Executor and addresses its afore-mentioned deficits. This new Executor provides fine-grained control of the mapping of callbacks to the scheduling primitives and mechanisms of the underlying RTOS, even across multiple nodes. ROS 2 allows bundling multiple nodes in one operating system process. To coordinate the execution of the callbacks of the nodes of a process, the Executor concept was introduced in rclcpp (and also in rclpy).

### Description
In order to address the challenges mentioned above, some changes are imminent: Firstly, an API to express real-time requirements on a callback level is needed and secondly, the Executor must be redesigned to respect these real-time requirements in its scheduling decisions. As the current ROS 2 Executor works at a node-level granularity – which is a limitation given that a node may issue different callbacks needing different real-time guarantees - we decided to refine the ROS 2 Executor API for more fine-grained control over the scheduling of callbacks on the granularity of callback groups using. We leverage the callback-group concept existing in rclcpp by introducing real-time profiles such as RT-CRITICAL and BEST-EFFORT in the callback-group API (i.e. rclcpp/callback_group.hpp). Each callback needing specific real-time guarantees, when created, may therefore be associated with a dedicated callback group. With this in place, we enhanced the Executor and depending classes (e.g., for memory allocation) to operate at a finer callback-group granularity. This allows a single node to have callbacks with different real-time profiles assigned to different Executor instances - within one process.

Thus, an Executor instance can be dedicated to specific callback group(s) and the Executor’s thread(s) can be prioritized according to the real-time requirements of these groups. For example, all time-critical callbacks are handled by an "RT-CRITICAL" Executor instance running at the highest scheduler priority.

The following figure illustrates this approach with two nodes served by three Callback-group-level Executors in one process:

![Sample system with two nodes and three Callback-group-level Executors in one process](cbg-executor_sample_system.png)

The different callbacks of the Drive-Base node are distributed to different Executors (visualized by the color red, yellow and green).  For example the onCmdVel and publishWheelTicks callback are scheduled by the same Executor (yellow). Callbacks from different nodes can be serviced by the same Executor.

### API Changes
In this section, we describe the necessary changes to the Executor API:
*   [include/rclcpp/callback\_group.hpp](https://github.com/micro-ROS/rclcpp/blob/cbg-executor-0.5.1/rclcpp/include/rclcpp/callback_group.hpp):

    * Introduced an enum to distinguish up to three real-time classes (requirements) per node (RealTimeCritical, SoftRealTime, BestEffort)
    * Changed association with Executor instance from nodes to callback groups.
*   [include/rclcpp/executor.hpp](https://github.com/micro-ROS/rclcpp/blob/cbg-executor-0.5.1/rclcpp/include/rclcpp/executor.hpp)

    * Added functions to add and remove individual callback groups in addition to whole nodes.

    * Replaced private vector of nodes with a map from callback groups to nodes.

*   [include/rclcpp/memory\_strategy.hpp](https://github.com/micro-ROS/rclcpp/blob/cbg-executor-0.5.1/rclcpp/include/rclcpp/memory_strategy.hpp)

    * Changed all functions that expect a vector of nodes to the just mentioned map.
*   [include/rclcpp/node.hpp](https://github.com/micro-ROS/rclcpp/blob/cbg-executor-0.5.1/rclcpp/include/rclcpp/node.hpp) and [include/rclcpp/node_interfaces/node_base.hpp](https://github.com/micro-ROS/rclcpp/blob/cbg-executor-0.5.1/rclcpp/include/rclcpp/node_interfaces/node_base.hpp)

    * Extended arguments of create\_callback\_group function for the real-time class.
    * Removed the get\_associated\_with\_executor\_atomic function.

All the changes can be found in the branches [cbg-executor-0.5.1](https://github.com/micro-ROS/rclcpp/tree/cbg-executor-0.5.1/rclcpp) and [cbg-executor-0.6.1](https://github.com/micro-ROS/rclcpp/tree/cbg-executor-0.6.1/rclcpp) for the corresponding version 0.5.1 and 0.6.1 of the rclcpp in the fork at [github.com/micro-ROS/rclcpp/](https://github.com/micro-ROS/rclcpp/).

### Meta-Executor Concept

The idea of the Meta Executor is to abstract away the callback-group assignment, thread allocation and other inner workings of the Executors from the user, thereby presenting a simple API that resembles the original Executor interface. Internally, the Meta Executor maintains multiple instances of our Callback-group-level Executor (Cbg-Executor).

The Meta Executor internally binds these Executors to the underlying kernel threads, assigns them a priority, chooses the scheduling mechanism (e.g., SCHED-FIFO policy) and then dispatches them. When adding a node with its list of callback group and real-time profiles to the Meta Executor, it parses the real-time profiles and assigns the node’s callback groups to the relevant internal Executors.

![Illustration of the Meta-Executor concept](meta-executor_concept.png)

### Test Bench

As a proof of concept, we implemented a small test bench in the present package cbg-executor_ping-pong_cpp. The test bench comprises a Ping node and a Pong node which exchange real-time and best-effort messages simultaneously with each other. Each class of messages is handled with a dedicated Executor, as illustrated in the following figure.

![Architecture for the Callback-group-level Executor test bench](cbg-executor_test-bench_architecture.png)
With the test bench, we validated the functioning of the approach - here on ROS 2 v0.5.1 with the Fast-RTPS DDS implementation - on a typical laptop.

![Results from Callback-group-level Executor test bench](cbg-executor_test-bench_results.png)

The test bench is provided in the [bg-executor_ping-pong_cpp](https://github.com/microROS/micro-ROS-demos/tree/master/Cpp/cbg-executor_ping-pong) package of the [micro-ROS-demos](https://github.com/microROS/micro-ROS-demos/) repository.

## RCL-Executor

The ROS 2 Executor is responsible for receiving incoming data, calling timers, services etc. The recent paper ) analyzed the Executor in detail. They found out, that these events are not processed in a pure FIFO fashion, but timers are preferred over all other events of the DDS queue. The implication is, that in a high-load situation, only pending timers will be processed while incoming DDS-events will be delayed or starved. Furthermore, the FIFO-strategy makes it difficult to determine time bounds on the total execution time, which are necessary for the verification of safety- and real-time requirements.

##### Concept
To solve these issues, we have implemented an RCL-Executor, which provides different scheduling strategies. Currently, two scheduling policies are implemented: static-order and priority-based scheduling.

In static-order-scheduling, all events, including timers, are processed in a pre-defined order. In case different events (timers, subscriptions, etc.) are available at the DDS queue, then they are all processed in the pre-defined static order.

In priority-based scheduling, a priority is defined for each event. If multiple events are available at the DDS queue, then only the event with the highest priority is processed.   

##### User API
The RCL-Executor is library written in C and is based on RCL. On implementation level we use a different terminology. In the RCL-Executor library an *event* is called a *handle* and *static-order* scheduling is called *FIFO* scheduling.

The RCL-Executor provides the following user interface:
* Initialization
  * Total number of handles
  * Scheduling policy (*FIFO*, *PRIORITY*)
* Configuration
  * rcle_executor_add_subscription()
  * rcle_executor_add_subscription_prio()
  * rcle_executor_add_timer()
  * rcle_executor_add_subscription_prio()
* Running
  * rcle_executor_spin_once()
  * rcle_executor_spin()

For the static-order scheduling, the user initializes the RCL-Executor with *FIFO* as scheduling policy and the total number of handles. Then, the handles are added the the RCL-Executor. The order of these method-calls defines the static-order for the scheduling, hence the name *FIFO* scheduling. Processing the handles is started by e.g. the *spin*-function.

For priority-based scheduling, the user initializes the RCL-Executor with *PRIORITY* as scheduling policy and the total number of handles. The specific priority of each handle is specified in the respective *rcle_executor_add-\*-prio* function. Processing the handles is started by e.g. the *spin*-function.

As resources are very constrained on micro-controllers, specific attention has been paid to the memory allocation: Dynamic memory is only allocated during the initialization phase to reserve memory for all handles. Later on, no memory is allocated while scheduling the handles (which was the case in the RCLC implementation).

The RCL-Executor and examples can be found in the repository [rcl-executor](https://github.com/micro-ROS/rcl_executor).


## Static-order scheduler
RT Executors

implementation:
- as thin-layer based on RCL (written in C)

API
- create executor
- add_subscription
- add_timer
- add_function
- spin_some
- spin_period

semantics:
fixed static order scheduling. All handles (callbacks, timers, services, etc.) are executed in the order
as they were added using the add_* methods to the executor.

LET semantics (reference to some scientific paper)
- read first, process, write
- benefit: no interference of write of some callbacks to any other callbacks in this round of evaluating DDS queue ()
take section from software architecture deliverable

implementation notes:
- implemented by: 1) creating a wait_set 2) rcl_wait() 3) rcl_take (for all ready handles) 4) scheduling of all handles in the static ORDER
- during configuration: dynamic allocation for n number of handles, during run-time (e.g. spin_some) no dynamic memory allocation (except within rcl_take(), where memory might be dynamically allocated for messages with variable length)

### Sense-Plan-Act Cycle in Fawkes

[Fawkes](http://www.fawkesrobotics.org/) is a robotic software framework, which supports synchronization points for sense-plan-act like execution. It has been developed by RWTH Aachen since 2006. Source code is available at [github.com/fawkesrobotics](https://github.com/fawkesrobotics).

Fawkes provides developers different synchronization points, which are very useful for defining an execution order of a typical sense-plan-act application. These ten synchronization points (wake-up hooks) are the following (cf. [libs/aspect/blocked_timing.h](https://github.com/fawkesrobotics/fawkes/blob/master/src/libs/aspect/blocked_timing.h)):

*   WAKEUP\_HOOK\_PRE\_LOOP
*   WAKEUP\_HOOK\_SENSOR\_ACQUIRE
*   WAKEUP\_HOOK\_SENSOR\_PREPARE
*   WAKEUP\_HOOK\_SENSOR\_PROCESS
*   WAKEUP\_HOOK\_WORLDSTATE
*   WAKEUP\_HOOK\_THINK
*   WAKEUP\_HOOK\_SKILL   
*   WAKEUP\_HOOK\_ACT     
*   WAKEUP\_HOOK\_ACT\_EXEC
*   WAKEUP\_HOOK\_POST\_LOOP  

At compile time, a desired synchronization point is defined as a constructor parameter for a module. For example, assuming that `mapLaserGenThread` shall be executed in SENSOR_ACQUIRE, the constructor is implemented as:

```C++
MapLaserGenThread::MapLaserGenThread()
  :: Thread("MapLaserGenThread", Thread::OPMODE_WAITFORWAKEUP),
     BlockedTimingAspect(BlockedTimingAspect::WAKEUP_HOOK_SENSOR_ACQUIRE),
     TransformAspect(TransformAspect::BOTH_DEFER_PUBLISHER, "Map Laser Odometry")
```

Similarly, if `NaoQiButtonThread` shall be executed in the SENSOR_PROCESS hook, the constructor is:

```C++
NaoQiButtonThread::NaoQiButtonThread()
  :: Thread("NaoQiButtonThread", Thread::OPMODE_WAITFORWAKEUP),
     BlockedTimingAspect(BlockedTimingAspect::WAKEUP_HOOK_SENSOR_PROCESS)
```

At runtime, the *executor* iterates through the list of synchronization points and executes all registered threads until completion. Then, the threads of the next synchronization point are called.

A module (thread) can be configured independent of these sense-plan-act synchronization points. This has the effect, that this thread is executed in parallel to this chain.

The high level overview of the Fawkes framework is shown in the next figure. At compile-time the configuration of the sense-plan act wakeup hook is done (upper part), while at run-time the scheduler iterates through this list of wakeup-hooks (lower part):

![Sequence diagram for executor concept in Fawkes](fawkes_executor_diagram.png)

Hence, at run-time, the hooks are executed as a fixed static schedule without preemption. Multiple threads registered in the same hook are executed in parallel.

Orthogonal to the sequential execution of sense-plan-act like applications, it is possible to define further constraints on the execution order by means of a `Barrier`. A barrier defines a number of threads, which need to have finished before the thread can start, which owns the barrier.

These concepts are implemented by the following main classes:

*   *Wakeup hook* by `SyncPoint` and `SyncPointManager`, which manages a list of synchronization points.
*   *Executor* by the class `FawkesMainThread`, which is the scheduler, responsible for calling the user threads.
*   `ThreadManager`, which is derived from `BlockedTimingExecutor`, provides the necessary API to add and remove threads to wakeup hooks as well as for sequential execution of the wakeup-hooks.
- `Barrier` is an object similar to `condition_variable` in C++.

**Discussion:** All threads are executed with the same priority. If multiple sense-plan-act chains shall be executed with different priorities, e.g. to prefer execution of emergency-stop over normal operation, then this framework reaches its limits.

Also, different execution frequencies cannot be modeled by a single instance of this sense-plan-act chain. However, in robotics the fastest sensor will drive the chain and all other hooks are executed with the same frequency.

The option to execute threads independent of the predefined wakeup-hooks is very useful, e.g. for diagnostics. The concept of the Barrier is useful for satisfying functional dependencies which need to be considered in the execution order.
